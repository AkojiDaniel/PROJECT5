1. Purpose of Importing Libraries

In data analysis, we frequently rely on specialized libraries to help us manipulate data, perform calculations, visualize trends, and make predictions. Here’s why we use each of these popular libraries:

Pandas: Provides data structures like DataFrames, which are powerful for managing and analyzing tabular data. It helps you load, clean, and manipulate data with ease.

NumPy: Offers support for large arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. Essential for numerical computations.

Matplotlib: A basic library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It helps visualize data with charts, making insights more accessible.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics, making visualizations easier to interpret.

SciPy: Used for scientific and technical computing. It offers modules for optimization, integration, and statistical functions, among others.

Scikit-learn (sklearn): A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and analysis. It’s commonly used for tasks like model select, regression,

```python
# Importing libraries for data analysis
import pandas as pd                 
# for data manipulation
import numpy as np                  
# for numerical computations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     
# for basic plotting
import seaborn as sns               
# for statistical data visualization
from scipy import stats             
# for scientific computations, especially statisticsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
# for splitting datasets
```
